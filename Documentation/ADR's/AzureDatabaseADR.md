Title: Decision to use azureSQL as database

Authors: Hamzah Docrat, Ahmad Moola, George Marantos, Sameer Lorgat

Context: We are developing a consultationwebsite that will need to store a large amount of data. We need to choose a database that will be able to handle the load and provide the performance and security that we need.

Alternatives: We could use MySQL, PostgreSQL

Decision: We have decided to use Azure SQL.

Consequences: Azure SQL is a fully managed database service that provides high availability, scalability, and security.

Reasons:

- Azure SQL is a fully managed database service, which means that Microsoft takes care of all of the administration and maintenance tasks. This frees up our team to focus on developing the application.
- Azure SQL is highly available, which means that it is always up and running. This is important for our application, as it will be used by customers 24/7.
- Azure SQL is scalable, which means that we can easily add more capacity as our application grows.
- Azure SQL is secure, which means that our data is protected from unauthorized access. This is important for us, as we handle sensitive data.
