1. Code will be completed on seperate group member branches, when a new feature is completed a pull request will be made from the member branch to the main branch.
2. Code reviews are completed on the pull request.
3. Code review is completed by a member of the group who is available to preform the review, as long as it is not the member who created the pull request.
